# OpenAPI Specification YAML Script with Swagger UI

This repository contains a YAML script used for creating an OpenAPI specification for a RESTful API.

## Repository Description

This repository houses a YAML script that creates an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification for designing RESTful APIs. OpenAPI is a set of rules for detailing RESTful APIs in a format that's easy to read and understand by both humans and machines. 

## Script Details 

The YAML script in this repository outlines the endpoints supported by our RESTful API, the HTTP methods each endpoint supports (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the data they consume and produce, and their error messages.

Here's a simplified example of what an OpenAPI specification YAML file might look like:


## Swagger UI Preview

You can preview and interact with the API as defined by this YAML script using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). Swagger UI is a tool that allows developers to visualize and interact with APIs defined by the OpenAPI specification.

Here is a screenshot of what the Swagger UI looks like:

## Installation 

To work with this script, you are required to have Swagger UI, which can be installed from [here](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
